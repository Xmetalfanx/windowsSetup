# Windows Setup
## Introduction 
This is my attempt at scripts to help setup a fresh Windows install, faster 

# Batch files
- install.bat
    - is the full file that I think is easier for one to comment out software they dont want (this is not like LinuxSetups at the moment ... this is mainly for me and my own usage specifically)
- install_slim.bat 
    - the idea is this is the same as install.bat but slimmed down in parts and if there is a more automated version ... this would be it ... or at least that is my intent 


# P(ower)S(hell) Script
- I plan on making a version for PS soon too ... even if not needed ... it is a learning experience for me learning PowerShell 

# Ideas 
- maybe have a text based file that is read and each line contains an app that people can comment out or leave as is ... and just have my batch or PS script read from that file and leave the app names "out of the code" so to speak
